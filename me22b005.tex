Electromagnetic radiations and microscopic matter waves exhibit a dual nature of mass/ momentum and wave character.Heisenbergâ€™s uncertainty principle states that for particles exhibiting both particle and wave nature, it will not be possible to accurately determine both the position and velocity at the same time.
This principle basically highlights that simultaneous measurement of position and the velocity or momentum of microscopic matter waves will have an error such that the product of the error in measurement of position and momentum is equal or more than an integral multiple of a constant.
