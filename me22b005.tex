\section{ME22B005}

Electromagnetic radiation and microscopic matter waves exhibit a dual nature of mass/momentum and wave character. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that for particles exhibiting both particle and wave nature, it is not possible to accurately determine both the position and velocity at the same time.

This principle highlights that the simultaneous measurement of position and momentum of microscopic matter waves will have an error such that the product of the error in position and momentum measurement is equal to or greater than an integral multiple of a constant, given by:

\begin{equation}
\Delta X \times \Delta p \ge \frac{h}{4\pi}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta X$ is the error in position measurement, $\Delta p$ is the error in momentum measurement, and $h$ is Planck's constant.
