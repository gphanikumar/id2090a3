\subsection{HAGEN-POISEUILLE'S LAW}
\subsection{Introduction}
This law was experimentally derived independently by G. Hagen and J. L. Poiseuille between 1838 and 1840. The assumptions of the equation are that the fluid is incompressible and Newtonian, the flow is laminar through a pipe of constant circular cross-section that is substantially longer than its diameter and there is no acceleration of fluid in the pipe.
\subsection{Equation}
\begin{equation}
    Q = \frac{\pi a^{4}}{8\mu} \frac{\Delta P}{l}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q$ = volume flow rate $(m^{3}/s)$
\item $\Delta P$ = $P_{1} - P_{2}$ = pressure difference ($Pa$ or $N/m^{2}$ or $kg/m \cdot s^{2}$)
\item $P_{1}$ = fliud pressure at entrance to tube ($Pa$)
\item $P_{2}$ = fluid pressure at exit from tube ($Pa$)
\item $a$ = tube radius ($m$)
\item $\mu$ = fluid viscosity ($kg/m \cdot s$ or $Pa \cdot s$), and
\item $l$ = length over which the pressure drop is measured ($m$).
\end{itemize}
