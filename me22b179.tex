\begin{equation}
    x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2
\end{equation}

This is the general equation of a sphere in the 3D coordinates (x,y,z). More specifically, this is a sphere about the origin (0,0,0). Modifying x, y and z, we shall obtain the equation of circle about any point in the coordinate system. This equation is really similar to the equation of a circle in the 2D plane because similar to a circle in 2D plane, a sphere can be mathematically defined as the set of all points that are at the same distance from a given point. That given point is known as the center of the sphere. The distance from the center is the radius, popularly known as "r".
