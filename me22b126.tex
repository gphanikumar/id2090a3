Faraday's law of induction (or simply Faraday's law) is a basic law of electromagnetism predicting how a magnetic field will interact with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force (emf)â€”a phenomenon known as electromagnetic induction. It is the fundamental operating principle of transformers, inductors, and many types of electric motors, generators and solenoids.The most widespread version of Faraday's law states:
The electromotive force around a closed path is equal to the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic flux enclosed by the path. \footnote{
