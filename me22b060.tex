\huge{Prony's Equation}  
\end{center}

The Prony equation \footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prony_equation}
is a historically important equation in hydraulics, used to calculate the head loss due to friction within a given run of pipe.This equation has been supplanted in modern hydraulics by the Darcy–Weisbach equation, which used it as a starting point.

The Prony equation and its replacement by the Darcy–Weisbach equation are on pp. 11–12}

where
\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item $h_f$ is the heat loss due to friction
    \item L is the Length of the pipe
    \item D is the diameter of the pipe
    \item V is the velocity of the flow
    \item a,b are empirical factors
\end{itemize}
