\section*{Radioactive Decay}
The spontaneous breakdown of an atomic nucleus of a radioactive substance resulting in the emission of radiation from the nucleus is known as Radioactive decay. The nuclide which undergoes decay in a radioactive process is a parent nuclide, and the nuclide which is produced in the radioactive process is a daughter nuclide.

The Radioactive Formula is given by
\begin{equation} \frac{dN}{dt}=-\lambda N \footnote{{\textit{References: Equations in Physics by ir.J.C.A. Wevers}}} \end{equation} 
\
Where, \\ $ N$ is the number of radioactive atoms present at time t,the negative sign indicates that the number of radioactive atoms decreases over time. \\
Also,
\begin{equation} N(t)=N_0e^{-\lambda t} \end{equation}  \ 
Where, \\ $ N(t)$ is the number of radioactive atoms present at time $t$,$N_0$ is the initial number of radioactive atoms, $\lambda$ is the decay constant.
