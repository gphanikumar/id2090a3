\subsection*{\underline{POTENTIAL ENERGY}}

\footnotemark{Potential energy is the energy held my an object because of its postion realtive to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge, or other factors.
Common types of potential energy include the gravitational potential energy of an object, the elastic potential energy of an extended spring, and the electric potential energy of an electric charge in an electric field. 
The unit for energy in the (SI) is the joule, which has the symbol J. PE, U or V are commonly used to represent the potential energy}

\begin{equation}
	\text{U} = \int_\text{r1}^\text{r2}{ \text{F(r)} dr}
	\label{eqn:erf}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}

\item F(r) is the force acting on the object
\item r1 is the initial point
\item r2 is the final point

\end{itemize}
