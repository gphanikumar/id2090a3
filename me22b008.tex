\begin{equation*}
    \huge\frac{1}{f}=(n-1)\left(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2}\right)

where,\\
f is the focal length (half the radius of curvature)\\
n is the refractive index of the material used\\
R1 is the radius of curvature of sphere 1\\
R2 is the radius of curvature of sphere 2 \\ 
\title{\textbf{Description:}} \\
The lens maker’s equation is a formula that gives us a relationship between the focal length, refractive index, and radii of curvature of the two spheres used in lenses.Lens manufacturers use the lens maker’s formula to manufacture lenses of the desired focal length. Lenses of different focal lengths are used for different optical instruments.
