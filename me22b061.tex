\[ v = u + at \]

In this equation,u is the initial velocity, v is the final velocity, a is the acceleration, t is the time period.
Equation of motion define the behaviour of a body as a function of time in newtonian mechanics.
Mathematical equation that relates velocity, acceleration, time.
This equation is used to determine the one unknown quantity, if all other 3 is known.
The equation of is valid for any particle/object travelling with constant acceleration.
