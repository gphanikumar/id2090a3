For a quadratic equation:
                
               \begin{center}
            \(ax^2 + bx + c =0\)   
               \end{center} 
                

Where x represents an unknown value, and a, b, and c represent known numbers, where a $\neq$ 0.
The numbers a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation and may be distinguished by respectively calling them, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant coefficient or free term.\footnote{ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic\_equation }\\


The values of x that satisfy the equation are called solutions of the equation. There are several ways to find these solutions. One such way is using the Quadratic formula.\\

The Quadratic Formula:
    \begin{center}
            \(x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\)   
               \end{center} \\

The + and - sign corresponds to each of the solutions of the equation.\\[\baselineskip]

The great news about the quadratic formula is that you may always use it! There are no quadratic equations where the quadratic formula will fail to provide a solution. Even in cases where there are no real solutions, the quadratic formula will still provide solutions!.\\


Conclusively, you will never go wrong with the quadratic formula!\\
