\section{Maxwell's Fourth Equation : Amp√®re's circuital law }

\begin{equation}
    \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c} ( 4\pi \mathbf{J} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} )
    \label{eq4}
\end{equation}

Ampere was a scientist experimenting with forces on wires carrying electric current. He was doing these experiments back in the 1820s, about the same time that Farday was working on Faraday's Law. Ampere and Farday didn't know that there work would be unified by Maxwell himself, about 4 decades later.
