Stokes Theorem (also known as Generalized Stoke’s Theorem) is a declaration about the integration of differential forms on manifolds, which both generalizes and simplifies several theorems from vector calculus. As per this theorem, a line integral is related to a surface integral of vector fields. Learn the stokes law here in detail with formula and proof.

The Stoke’s theorem states that “the surface integral of the curl of a function over a surface bounded by a closed surface is equal to the line integral of the particular vector function around that surface.”
\begin{equation}
    \oint_C \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} = \int_S \nabla \times \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{S}
\end{equation}\\
Where,
C = A closed curve. \\
S = Any surface bounded by C.\\
F = A vector field whose components have continuous derivatives in an open region of $R^3$containing S.\\ 
Stokes’ theorem provides a relationship between line integrals and surface integrals.Stokes’ theorem and the generalized form of this theorem are fundamental in determining the line integral of some particular curve and evaluating a bounded surface’s curl. Generally, this theorem is used in physics.
