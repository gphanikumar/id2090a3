abstract = {This chapter introduces the fluid mechanics principles. The chapter starts with the history of body fluid and biofluid mechanics since 2500 bc. Then, it reviews the scope of biofluid mechanics and its applications. The chapter clarifies some important aspects, such as dimensions, units and dimensional analysis in engineering equations. By the end of the chapter the basic principles and formulas in fluid mechanics, including density, velocity, pressure, volumetric flow rate and mass flow rate, are explained.}
